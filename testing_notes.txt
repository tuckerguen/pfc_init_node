Notes on Testing Goals and Methods
-------------------------------------
Performance metrics:
Measure candidate point quality (rotation and location errors)
Measure time 

Goals:
Understand relationship of parameters and scenarios and our performance metrics

Methods:
Environment configuration: Planar vs non-planar
Inner loop (y-axis): For each metric, run each parameter set on the same set of randomly generated poses
Outer loop (x-axis): Modify a parameter at some increment
After running each modified parameter set on the set of poses, we should have a good metric for the performance of the algorithm in relation to the parameters

Relationships to Analyze:
Planar Rotation:
    Yaw increment vs:
        time, rot_err, loc_err
NonPlanar Rotation:
    Yaw increment vs:
        time, rot_err, loc_err
    Pitch increment vs:
        time, rot_err, loc_err
    Roll increment vs:
        time, rot_err, loc_err
    Pitch max, fixed inc vs:
        time, rot_err, loc_err
    Roll max, fixed inc vs:
        time, rot_err, loc_err    
    
    Fixed increment, non-planar rotation (roll and pitch):

# Performance Notes
Individually, each axis does quite well, within a good tolerance. So checking for one axis when the needle is only changing
on that one axis works really well.

Once we add in checking for all axes, even if only one axis is changing, we still see a significant decrease in performance

# Difficult cases
The most difficult cases appear to be "edge-on" or really close needles. The side on ones and close ones share a similar
problem where all the father away ("smaller") needles that are edge-on match really well. So the majority of candidate
points are really bad, and it's just a matter of probability as to whether or not the closest match actually has the
best matching score.

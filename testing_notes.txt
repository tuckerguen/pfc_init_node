Notes on Testing Goals and Methods
-------------------------------------
Performance metrics:
Measure candidate point quality (rotation and location errors)
Measure time 

Goals:
Understand relationship of parameters and scenarios and our performance metrics

Methods:
Environment configuration: Planar vs non-planar
Inner loop (y-axis): For each metric, run each parameter set on the same set of randomly generated poses
Outer loop (x-axis): Modify a parameter at some increment
After running each modified parameter set on the set of poses, we should have a good metric for the performance of the algorithm in relation to the parameters

Relationships to Analyze:
Planar Rotation:
    Yaw increment vs:
        time, rot_err, loc_err
NonPlanar Rotation:
    Yaw increment vs:
        time, rot_err, loc_err
    Pitch increment vs:
        time, rot_err, loc_err
    Roll increment vs:
        time, rot_err, loc_err
    Pitch max, fixed inc vs:
        time, rot_err, loc_err
    Roll max, fixed inc vs:
        time, rot_err, loc_err    
    
    Fixed increment, non-planar rotation (roll and pitch):
        # cand pts
